\n","Instead of creating image annotations from scratch, EOL user-generated cropping coordinates are used to create training and testing data to teach object detection models and evaluate model accuracy for YOLO via darkflow, SSD and Faster-RCNN object detection models, respectively. \n","\n","Following the [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle), 80% of the original EOL crops dataset are randomly selected to be training data and the remaining 20% will be used to test model accuracy. \n","\n","Resulting train and test datasets are exported for further pre-processing in [lepidoptera_preprocessing.ipynb](https://github.com/aubricot/object_detection_for_image_cropping/blob/master/lepidoptera_preprocessing.ipynb), before they are ready to use with the object detection models."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"NVLY-E_tsqFy","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":122},"outputId":"b542b739-8af6-4282-9f17-bfa67da480a8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1582056399677,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":25376,"user":{"displayName":"EOL
